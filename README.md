# CS250-SDLC
This is the summation of what I learned from my Software Development Lifecycle class from SNHU.


# How do I interpret user needs and implement them into a program? How does creating “user stories” help with this?

User need and by extension user stories are an important part of program development.
When designing and implementing a program we always need to keep are end users in mind.
Regardless of our final product if our users are not satisfied, then ultimately the program is a failure.
User Stories gives us a clear view of what the user requires and how it should work within the program.
As a Product Owner, collecting thorough User Stories is vital to the success of the project.



# How do I approach developing programs? What agile processes do I hope to incorporate into my future development work?

One aspect that SNHU does very well is having one or two projects that are worked on throughout the term.
This allows us as students to work on a project similar to how we would perform sprints in the future.
By replicating this we have the opportunity to see how a team would potentially work through a sprint and determine
the next goals or tasks for the end project's goal.
When working on personal projects I try to incorporate this methodology.
By doing this I can make the minimum required functions and logic before cleaning the program up and making as good as I possibly can.




# What does it mean to be a good team member in software development?

To me one of the biggest take-aways from this class and from my past work experience is how important communication is within a team.
Without effective communication a team will never be able to work together efficiently.
To me a good team member needs to communicate within the team to help grow the team.
Not only does this help grow the team member's skills but by investing in other team members they are able to help other team members grow.
Working with Agile in a team is rapidly becoming a crucial skill in software development.
As a result, working with Agile in software development should be incorporated into projects whenever possible.
